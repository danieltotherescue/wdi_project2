# Project2 - Buskr

Buskr is an application intended to enable people who saw performers on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade to be able to post their favorites, find performers they didn't get the website of, browse what impressed other users, or find more information on upcoming performances of performers they saw.

#####MVP
Users will be able to browse posts by other users who have seen promenade performers who impressed them and/or that they took a picture of but need further info about.  In this way, users can learn more about performers and help each other find and follow their favorite street performers (or just performers that they wanted to know more about or remember the name of).  Street Performers will benefit by increased exposure, recognition, and following. Maybe.

Technologies used:
HTML 5, CSS 3, Sass, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ruby, rails, PostgreSQL and Devise

Installation/startup instructions:
Go to the heroku website link listed above and sign up, browse, post, and enjoy. Learn about performances in your community.


Approach taken: My approach was a back-end forward approach, prioritizing functionality over styling, though I got a little too into the styling toward the end.

Unsolved problems and next steps:  I was hoping to be able to have dynamic photo and video upload capability, but I ran into quite a few problems using paperclip and AWS.  Next step is to accomplish photo and other engaging functionality in the site.
